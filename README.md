# 📚 Family Reading Grove

**Family Reading Grove** is a full-stack web application designed to help families track children's reading progress in a fun and engaging way. Parents can assign books and prizes, children can log their reading sessions, and everyone can stay motivated with visual progress tracking.

## 🎓 About the Project

This project was created in a team of three as our capstone for Tech Elevator. We followed agile practices, built the app from the ground up in under two weeks, and presented it at our graduation expo.
